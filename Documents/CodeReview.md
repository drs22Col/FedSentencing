# Code Review

1. In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?

ChloeHacker: Public Transportation Ridership-- Yes, it was clear: there were links to 4 Jupiter notebooks in the readme that had all the code and outputs. (What a climate change related event meant in terms of ridership could also be more explicitly explained upfront.)

Julia: Acoustics in Python -- Yes, it was clear. I had to read it twice, and check out the notebooks, but once I read the notebooks and understood the project, I found that the ReadMe was actually clear. 

Mistergroot: Coral Reefs-- This was the clearest of them all. Terrific doumentation throughout this project. 

2. Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?

ChloeHacker - She had the scripts in the Jupiter notebooks, and a file in the Project directory directing you to those notebooks.

Julia -- Yes, seems clear, though because unfamiliar with the sound data jargon/terminology here, was not totally clear to me. 

Mistergroot -- In the projects folder, referred people to the notebooks, where the code is. 


3. Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?

ChloeHacker - Yes, it was very clear, with a lot of comments. 

Julia -- Yes, she included notebooks with code and outputs. The visualizations in the notebooks (using pickle, which I never heard of before) were really cool. I understood what she was trying to do, and also how she adjusted her original plan. 

Mistergroot-- The documentation was excellent, the best of the three. Very clearly explained how to clean data, create the bokeh visualization, and then embed/host the app on heroku. Well organized and very clear, with lots of very specific comments and instructions. 


4. Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?

I liked the use of Jupyter Notebooks, which have the output right after the code, and allow for ample annotation. Unfortunately DASH does not run in Jupyter Notebooks, but I would use this technique for other projects. I found Mistergroot's panda data cleaning techniques very helpful as a model. And I also plan to refer to his heroku notebook in the future as well, for hosting my own app -- and also his bokeh notebook, since I may bokeh for a map app as well. I learned the most from his project.
